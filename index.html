            <h2>Victoria on the Move</h2>
            <p>Victoria has a road network of around 23,000km with a value of $27 billion, it supports 350 million tonnes of freight each year. The road network is vital to keeping Victoria moving and allowing the economy to thrive. Safety and efficiency are at the core of the road network and Victorians demand the highest level of safety possible. <br><br> This analysis will provide a general overview into accidents that occurred in 2018 as well as an in-depth look into one of the projects that has improved safety on Victoria's roads. The data was obtained from the Victorian Department of Transportation and can be accessed via the link at the bottom of this webpage. <br><br> The map of Victoria above shows the distribution of accidents that occurred during 2018, one dot represents one accident. As you can see there is a high density of collision around areas with higher populations. Ideally this would be normalised by km travelled in each area however due to the lack of data available this has been achieved by normalising by population to achieve a similar result. <br><br>As you can see there are four LGAs with high accident rates, these are no surprise as they relate to alpine regions such as Falls Creek and Mt Buller as well as the popular tourist spot The Great Ocean Road, all of which are known for difficult driving conditions. </p>          </div>

          <h2>Weekends and Weekdays</h2>
          <p>The bar chart on the left shows the number of accidents by day of the week and also allows you to select an accident type. Breaking down accidents by the day of the week produces some interesting insights.<br><br> There is a distinct difference in common accidents on weekends compared to weekdays, for example there is significantly more collisions with other cars on the weekdays likely due to increased traffic loads. In contrast, there is far less accidents that don't involve a collision such as spinning out of control that occur on weekdays which is likely due to people driving their regular route on weekdays and then driving in less familiar places on weekend outings.<br><br> Collisions with fixed objects is another category that spikes on the weekends likely due to similar circumstances. </p>

            <h2>Bolte Bridge Upgrades</h2>
            <p>The Bolte Bridge is located in Docklands, Melbourne and connects traffic from the north-south running part of City-link to the Westgate Freeway. It is a vital arterial of Melbourne and any disruption on this road causes major delays throughout the broader road network.<br><br> At the end of 2017 the Victorian Government upgraded the inbound connections to the Westgate Freeway to make the Bolte Bridge safer and more efficient. These upgrades included more lanes, better overhead and on-road signage and variable speed technology. These upgrades are designed to ensure drivers have plenty of advanced warning to move into their desired lane which was the primary cause of many of the accidents.<br><br> As a result of the upgrades you can see the reduction of accidents on the bridge from before the upgrade (2016-2017) to after completion (2018) below. The map is orientated north up and has city link running vertically down the map connecting to the West Gate Freeways which is the major road at the bottom of the map. The Bolte Bridge is on the centre of the map and is also depicted right.</p>
